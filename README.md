# LSTM-Model
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly well-suited for time series forecasting, including applications in solar energy prediction. The unique architecture of LSTMs allows them to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them effective for forecasting solar power generation, which is influenced by various dynamic environmental factors.models have emerged as a powerful tool for forecasting electricity consumption due to their ability to learn from sequential data and capture temporal dependencies. Various studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LSTM in predicting energy usage patterns across different contexts.LSTM models have proven to be highly effective in forecasting electricity consumption across different scenarios. Their ability to learn from historical data while accounting for various influencing factors makes them a valuable asset in energy management strategies. As research continues to refine these models and integrate them with other methodologies, their application is likely to expand further in the realm of energy forecasting and management.
